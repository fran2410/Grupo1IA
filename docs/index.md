## Description

This repository provides a complete pipeline for the advanced analysis of scientific articles. Starting from a corpus of 30 PDF papers, it processes them using [GROBID](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid), extracts metadata and named entities, performs semantic analyses such as topic modeling and document similarity, and builds an enriched and visualizable RDF knowledge graph.

!!! info
    For any issues or questions, please open an issue in the [project issues](https://github.com/fran2410/Grupo1IA/issues).

## Features
Given a PDF file (or a directory with some of them) the tool will extract the data and make:
- Metadata and acknowledgments extraction from XML files generated by GROBID.
- Topic modeling using embeddings and KeyBERT.
- Similarity computation between abstracts using Sentence Transformers.
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) in acknowledgment sections.
- Knowledge graph (RDF) construction with metadata, topics, authors, and relationships.
- Interactive visualization through a app.py demo.

## Used Technologies and Standards

### Grobid
We use [GROBID](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid) to process scientific documents and extract their XML files for use as data input.


### HuggingFace
We use [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) to analyse the papers using different NER.
