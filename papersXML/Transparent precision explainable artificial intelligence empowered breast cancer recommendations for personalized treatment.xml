<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">CONCEPTUALIZATION AND METHODOLOGY 2.1. Breast cancer</head><p>Breast cancer is a prevalent and complex disease which affects large number of individuals worldwide, primarily women. It is a cancer type that develops in the cells of the breast tissue, most commonly in the milk ducts or the milk-producing glands. While breast cancer can occur in men, it is far more common in women, making it the leading cancer diagnosis among females. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous and multifaceted condition, which means that it can evident in various forms, exhibit different characteristics, and require varied treatment approaches. Understanding the basics of breast cancer is vital for both patients and healthcare professionals to facilitate early detection, diagnosis, and effective management <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Precision medicine</head><p>Precision medicine, also referred as personalized medicine, is a ground breaking approach to healthcare that recognizes the uniqueness of each patient. It employs genetic, genomic, environmental, and lifestyle data to tailor medical decisions and treatments. Key components include genomics, personalized diagnostics, targeted therapies, individualized treatment plans, predictive analytics, preventive measures, and ongoing monitoring. This approach aims to provide more accurate diagnoses, customized treatments, and better healthcare outcomes. Precision medicine has already made significant strides, particularly in fields like oncology, and it has led to innovative therapies and interventions. With advancing technology and a deeper understanding of genetics and diseases, precision medicine is expected to continue growing, offering the potential for truly individualized care, better patient outcomes, and reduced healthcare costs. It represents a transformative shift in healthcare that emphasizes personalized and effective healthcare for all <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Precision medicine in breast cancer treatment involves tailoring medical decisions and therapies to the unique characteristics of each patient and their tumour. This approach begins with molecular subtyping, identifying specific breast cancer subtypes. Targeted therapies are then employed based on the molecular characteristics, such as hormone receptor status and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression. Genomic profiling helps identify genetic mutations and resistance mechanisms, informing treatment choices and prognosis. Personalized treatment plans consider the patient's health and tumour characteristics, optimizing therapy while minimizing side effects. Clinical trials explore innovative treatments, and post-treatment surveillance detects recurrence early. Precision medicine enhances treatment effectiveness, survival rates, and quality of life for breast cancer patients, with ongoing advancements promising even more personalized care.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Machine learning</head><p>Machine learning (ML) is a transformative field of AI that has gained immense prominence in recent years. It empowers computers and systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. This capability has far-reaching implications across various industries, from finance to healthcare to autonomous vehicles and natural language processing. At its core, ML revolves around the concept of enabling machines to increase their performance on a task through experience, just as humans do. This experiential learning is achieved by feeding large volumes of data into algorithms that adapt and evolve over time. As these algorithms process more data, their ability to make accurate predictions or decisions steadily improves <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>ML can be broadly categorized into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, each with its unique applications and techniques. In supervised learning, algorithms are trained on labelled datasets, allowing them to make predictions or classifications based on input data. Unsupervised learning involves clustering and dimensionality reduction, uncovering hidden patterns in data without explicit labels. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, focuses on decision-making in dynamic environments, where an agent learns by interacting with its surroundings and receiving feedback.</p><p>The applications of ML are virtually limitless. It has revolutionized fields like image recognition, speech processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and even scientific research. Its ability to analyse vast datasets quickly and accurately makes it an indispensable tool in modern data-driven industries. As ML continues to advance, it holds the potential to transform industries, enhance automation, and drive innovation. Its real-world impact is already evident in self-driving cars, personalized healthcare, and virtual assistants. However, it also raises important ethical and societal questions, such as those related to privacy, bias, and accountability. In this era of data abundance, ML stands as a powerful tool for extracting knowledge, making predictions, and enabling automation. Its evolution promises to reshape the way we live and work, offering exciting opportunities and challenges in the ever-expanding realm of AI <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p></div>
