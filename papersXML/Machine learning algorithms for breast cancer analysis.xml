<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers</head><p>BERT, a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model, employs a transformer-based architecture. Through pre-training on extensive text data, BERT excels at capturing contextual relationships in language. In the context of breast cancer detection, BERT proves invaluable for analyzing clinical text data, such as medical reports or patient records. Preprocessing steps for BERT involve tokenization, where the text is split into individual tokens or words, and subsequent padding or truncation to ensure a consistent input length for the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Long short-term memory</head><p>LSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), is particularly effective in processing sequential data. Its strength lies in capturing long-term dependencies, making it highly suitable for analyzing time-series data or patient records. In the realm of breast cancer detection, LSTM finds utility in analyzing sequential medical data <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, such as longitudinal patient records, thereby uncovering patterns or trends indicative of breast cancer. Preprocessing steps for LSTM may involve scaling or normalizing the input data to ensure numerical stability and feature engineering techniques to extract relevant information <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Naive Bayes and support vector machine</head><p>Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm rooted in Bayes theorem, assuming independence among features <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Dataset</head><p>This section outlines the methods employed in our research for breast cancer detection using machine learning algorithms. We describe the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset used, the preprocessing steps applied, the implementation of the BERT, LSTM, naive Bayes, and SVM algorithms, as well as the evaluation metrics utilized. Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset: we utilized the well-known Breast Cancer Wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset, which contains clinical measurements of breast cancer cells from fine-needle aspirates. The dataset consists of various features, such as cell nucleus characteristics, including radius, texture, smoothness, compactness, concavity, and symmetry. Each sample in the dataset is labeled as either benign or malignant, providing the ground truth for training and evaluation as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. In this dataset, there are a total of 569 instances or samples. Each instance is described by 30 features, which include various measurements of cell nucleus characteristics such as radius, texture, smoothness, compactness, concavity, and symmetry. The dataset does not contain any missing values, ensuring complete information for analysis. The class labels for each instance indicate whether the sample is benign or malignant, providing the ground truth for training and evaluation purposes. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset serves as a valuable resource for breast cancer detection and classification tasks. Its comprehensive set of features derived from fine-needle aspirates enables the development and evaluation of machine learning algorithms for accurate diagnosis and prediction of breast cancer cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Preprocessing</head><p>Prior to training the machine learning algorithms, we performed preprocessing steps to ensure the quality and compatibility of the data. This involved handling missing values, if any, by either removing the corresponding instances or imputing the missing values with appropriate techniques. We also standardized or normalized the feature values to bring them to a consistent scale, which helps prevent any undue influence of features with larger ranges on the models' performance. This step is essential to the whole process to ensure the absence of confusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Machine learning algorithms</head><p>In our study, we implemented the BERT algorithm, created an LSTM model from scratch, utilized a naive Bayes classifier, and employed an SVM classifier for breast cancer detection using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. For BERT, we utilized pretrained model and fine-tuned it on our dataset, leveraging its powerful capabilities in analyzing textual information. However, it is important to note that the LSTM model was developed from scratch, allowing us to tailor it specifically to our dataset and capture the sequential patterns associated with breast cancer. In addition, the naive Bayes and SVM classifiers were trained using the numerical features extracted from the dataset. These models were built from the ground up, configuring them with appropriate parameters and hyperparameters to optimize their performance. We utilized suitable optimization algorithms to train both the naive Bayes and SVM classifiers, ensuring their effectiveness in breast cancer detection. Furthermore, we also developed a random forest model from scratch for breast cancer detection. Random forest is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. We constructed the random forest model by creating a collection of decision trees and aggregating their predictions to make the final classification decision. This approach allowed us to leverage the collective wisdom of multiple trees, resulting in a more robust and reliable breast cancer detection model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Evaluation metrics</head><p>To evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithms, we employed standard evaluation metrics including accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, precision <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, and F1 score <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the predictions, while precision focuses on the true positive rate. Recall measures the ability to correctly identify positive instances, and the F1 score provides a balance between precision and recall. Additionally, we employed techniques such as k-fold cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation and mitigate the impact of dataset bias or randomness. These evaluation metrics help assess the effectiveness of machine learning models in breast cancer detection tasks, considering different aspects such as accuracy, precision, recall, and overall predictive power. The metrics provide valuable insights into the model's ability to correctly classify benign and malignant instances, identify false positives and false negatives, and discriminate between the two classes.</p></div>
