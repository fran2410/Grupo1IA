<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Breast cancer continues to be one of the foremost illnesses that results in the deaths of numerous women each year. Among the female population, approximately 8% are diagnosed with Breast cancer (BC), following Lung Cancer. The alarming rise in fatality rates can be attributed to breast cancer being the second leading cause. Breast cancer manifests through genetic transformations, persistent pain, alterations in size, color (redness), and texture of the breast's skin. Pathologists rely on the classification of breast cancer to identify a specific and targeted prognosis, achieved through binary classification (normal/abnormal). Artificial intelligence (AI) has been employed to diagnose breast tumors swiftly and accurately at an early stage. This study employs the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning technique for the detection and analysis of breast cancer. XGBoost provides an accuracy of 94.74% and recall of 95.24% on Wisconsin breast cancer Wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Breast cancer is one of the primary causes of disease prevalence among both women and men. The presence of cancerous cells within the body is often indicated by early symptoms exhibited by the patient. The course of treatment and prognosis are contingent upon the specific type of malignant growth, the extent of its spread, and the patient's overall health condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Possible therapeutic approaches include surgical intervention, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The survival rate is determined by various factors such as the stage of cancer, general well-being, and other individual characteristics. Unfortunately, only a mere 14% of individuals diagnosed with breast cancer manage to survive for a period of five years. Indications that may raise suspicion of breast cancer encompass the presence of a lump, alterations in the skin, nipple discharge, swelling, breast pain, fatigue, insomnia, gastrointestinal difficulties, and respiratory distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>The rapid increase in computational resources, driven by technological advancements, has led to the availability of highdimensional data. This has made it possible to accurately diagnose and predict the prognosis and treatment outcome of breast cancers. Imaging techniques, such as mammography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging, contribute to the characterization of malignant regions, providing valuable information for definitive diagnoses. Furthermore, molecular-based profiling data obtained through omics technologies, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, have played a role in identifying dysregulated molecular pathways in breast cancer. To fully utilize the clinical potential and gain insights into tumorigenesis and progression, sophisticated computational analyses are necessary alongside traditional statistical approaches.</p><p>Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, has emerged as a computational analytical methodology to analyze the vast amount of data generated. Within machine learning, there are unsupervised and supervised methods. Unsupervised methods involve extracting features without prior knowledge of the expected results. Clustering techniques, for example, are commonly used to analyze omics data, such as subtype-specific expression patterns in transcriptome data. On the other hand, supervised methods mimic given results by combining observed features. Diverse machine learning techniques, for example, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, naïve Bayes algorithm, random forests, and decision trees, have been used for this purpose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Literature Reviews</head><p>Recent studies have proven the ability of artificial intelligence to give accurate results that help specialists make better decisions due to its ability to capture details better than Humans. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, four of Machine Learning algorithms, which are Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), with five different breast cancer datasets are tested and analyzed to verify their performance in a binary classification of breast cancer. The results show that CNN obtained higher accuracy than the other tested algorithms in this type of data. The accuracy obtained by RF, SVM, and KNN was 91%, 90% and 84%, respectively using Wisconsin diagnostic dataset in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, four machine learning models such as Linear regression, Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptron and Decision Trees (DT) were applied.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>In this section, the proposed methodology will be discussed in details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Description of Dataset</head><p>The performance of the machine learning techniques is based on the availability of a suitable and valid dataset. The following dataset is being used in this research.</p><p>As per the documentation of the dataset, the dataset [20] encompasses attributes pertaining to the attributes of cellular nuclei. These attributes are derived from a digitized representation of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The dataset comprises 569 rows, where each row denotes a distinct digitized image of a breast mass, and 33 columns. Out of 569 rows, no column is missing data besides the "Unnamed: 32" column which only has null values. The "Unnamed: 32" column along with the "id" column has been removed since neither will be useful for our analysis. Each digitized image either contains benign (i.e. non-cancerous) or malignant (i.e. cancerous) breast cells. We should determine how many are benign and how many are malignant. The total number of malignant (M) and benign (B) samples is 212 and 357, respectively. So, out of 569 instances in our dataset: 357 contained benign breast cells (62.74%), 212 contained malignant breast cells (37.26%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Visualization of Features</head><p>In order to visually represent the relationships between features for images of both benign and malignant cells, an effective approach would be to employ box plots. By grouping the data into sets of 10, we can gain insight into the distribution of the data and identify any outliers that may be present. It is worth noting that our dataset comprises 30 distinct features.</p><p>From figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, it is seen that the average radius of malignant breast cells in images is larger than benign cells. Other metrics related to cell size such as perimeter and area also share this relationship. However, there are outlier benign cells that just happen to have the larger average radius of a malignant cell. The mean fractal dimension box plots have very similar medians and therefore this feature probably lacks predictive power for diagnosis differentiation. The characteristics found within this particular subset, as depicted in figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, appear to be less distinct and therefore have less predictive power. It is possible that features such as Area_se, perimeter_se, and radius_se could hold some predictive value, although it is worth noting that there are still a considerable number of outlier benign cells that exhibit similar sizes to malignant cells. Furthermore, there is a small subset of malignant cells that possess a smaller size typically associated with benign cells, as evidenced by the lower whisker of the blue malignant box plot overlapping with the median value of the orange benign box plot. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the worst feature values for malignant and benign breast cell images.  The swarm plot shown in figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> provides a clearer representation of how outliers are blending in with the usual values for the other diagnosis. In the plot for fractal_dimension_mean, both malignant and benign observations are spread out across the entire plot. This relatively equal distribution once again suggests that this particular feature does not have much predictive ability. There is a more noticeable separation in the plots for radius_mean and area_mean. It is worth highlighting once again that features related to the size of the nucleus show potential predictive power. The plots for perimeter_mean and concave points_mean also appear to indicate some level of predictive ability.   <ref type="figure">5</ref> describes the smaller correlation heatmap for the 7 features we identified as being most promising for predictive power.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Results of XGBoost</head><p>Many of the highly correlated features are very predictive. In contrast to linear regression models, machine learning models like XGBoost and Random Forest models are generally resistant to multicollinearity between features. Hence, for this problem, we will refrain from using a linear regression model. However, we choose XGBoost for the following reasons:  With 30 features, XGBoost excels at managing the intricate relationships between them.  XGBoost is capable of handling multicollinearity between features without compromising its performance.  Compared to other machine learning options, XGBoost is known for its speed and efficiency due to its implementation of parallel processing.  XGBoost provides a wider range of hyperparameters to fine-tune the model.</p><p> Additionally, XGBoost offers the option to plot feature importance, which proves to be highly valuable for our research question.</p><p>The learning rate and max depth is chosen to 0.   4 instances of False Positives, where the model inaccurately predicts that an image contains malignant breast cells when they are actually benign.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Most Important Features to the XGBoost</head><p>After training the model to recognize patterns in breast cell nuclei, we found out which features are most important for telling apart benign and malignant cells. According to Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, the model considers concave points_worst and area_worst as the most crucial, with both getting the highest F-score of 5.0 among the 14 features. Texture_worst and area_se also stand out with an F-score of 4.0 each. Gradient boosting refers to the process of "boosting" or strengthening one weak model by fusing it with a number of other weak models to create a more robust model as a whole. As an extension of boosting, gradient boosting formalizes the process of additively creating weak models as a gradient descent method over an objective function. To reduce errors, gradient boosting establishes desired results for the following model. The gradient of the error with regard to the prediction determines the desired objectives for each case, therefore the name "gradient boosting. Table <ref type="table">I</ref> shows the comparison between XGBoost and several existing systems based on accuracy as well as the number of instances and attributes were used. The table clarify that our proposed system with XGBoost algorithm is better than the existing systems in terms of performance. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>Most women suffer from breast cancer due to their unconsciousness. Various machine learning techniques are available to analyses medical data, but creating an effective and computationally efficient classifier is a significant machine learning challenge. We have used Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML algorithms in this paper. By applying this algorithm we have got accuracy of 94.74% accuracy for XGBoost. We will try to strengthen our work in future by handling a comparatively large dataset and incorporating some more functions such as breast cancer phase detection and so on. We hope that this study will contribute in the clinical application of breast cancer treatment.</p></div>
