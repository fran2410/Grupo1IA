<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>With the development of photorealistic diffusion models, models trained in part or fully on synthetic data achieve progressively better results. However, diffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in reality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture artifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a synthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic images containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered infeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered out-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a model's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be excluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility really matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is necessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers, focusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We introduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to include feasible or infeasi-ble attributes given by the textual prompt generated by a large language model. Our experiments show that feasibility minimally affects LoRA-fine-tuned CLIP performance, with mostly less than 0.3% difference in top-1 accuracy across three fine-grained datasets. Also, the attribute matters on whether the feasible/infeasible images adversarially influence the classification performance. Finally, mixing feasible and infeasible images in training datasets does not significantly impact performance compared to using purely feasible or infeasible datasets.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We propose VariReal, a pipeline for minimal-change editing of real images, enabling isolation of target attributes in three categories: background, color, and texture. We compare images generated by VariReal to those produced by prior text-guided editing methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, examining both feasible and infeasible attributes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, large-scale pre-trained models <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref> have significantly surpassed traditional learning approaches in various tasks. However, as the scale of training data grows, access to high-quality data has become increasingly limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, posing challenges to further improving these large models' capabilities. With the popularity of generative models <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> like Stable Diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, researchers are increasingly leveraging these models to generate high-fidelity synthetic data that closely resembles real-world data, offering a solution to data scarcity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</p><p>Prior studies have explored synthetic data generation under a limited few-shot real image setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref>]. These works aim to create synthetic data that approximates the real-world data distribution while avoiding overfitting to the limited available examples. Some studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> suggest that synthetic data can offer benefits beyond those of real data. However, the inherent randomness in the diffusion-based image generation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref> can introduce domain shifts <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> or implausible scenarios, such as "a dog floating in the sky" <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, which fail to reflect realistic patterns. Such data could intuitively be perceived as out-of-distribution (OOD), potentially becoming counterproductive for downstream tasks.</p><p>Interestingly, previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> suggest that OOD data can positively impact downstream tasks when mixed with real data in certain proportions. A typical example is data augmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, where some data augment methods introduce OOD data relative to the original distribution yet still provide benefits. While these advantages generally diminish as divergence from the original distribution increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, these findings demonstrate OOD data is not always harmful. Conversely, incorporating feasible content, which is considered in-distribution, is naturally beneficial. For instance, Dunlap et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> propose augmenting training data by synthesizing data with diverse feasible backgrounds and show performance gain. This raises a question: does the feasibility matter for synthetic training data?</p><p>In this paper, we study the impact of the feasibility on synthesized data when using them as training data for the classification task. We define feasibility as whether classspecific attributes could realistically occur in the real world. Attributes that meet this criterion are considered feasible while others are infeasible. For instance, given a Yorkshire terrier in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, it is likely to find it at the lake shore, while not at the oil rig platform. Therefore, we assume an image of Yorkshire terrier at the lake shore background as a feasible image, while an image of it at the oil rig platform as an infeasible image.</p><p>To generate feasible and infeasible images and study their impact of a downstream classification task, we propose VariReal, an editing pipeline with minimal change of attributes given a real image. We first generate a list of feasible and infeasible attribute names for each class by using GPT-4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, with generated attributes further being validated through a user study. We then use a proposed imageediting pipeline based on Stable Diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> that generates feasible (or infeasible) images given a source real image and a prompt with a feasible (or infeasible) attribute name. We then assess the impact of the feasibility of images to downstream tasks by fine-tuning CLIP-based classifiers under two conditions: synthetic-only training and mixed real-synthetic training.</p><p>Our study of feasibility for a downstream task in three different attributes (background, color, texture) on three fine-grained datasets reveals the following insights. First, we show that changing the background regardless of feasibility brings performance gain, which loosens a restriction considered in ALIA <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> where it only uses a feasible background scenario. Second, foreground modifications, like color or texture attributes, often challenge the classifier's learning process especially when the training datasets are infeasible inputs.</p><p>In summary, our contributions are as follows: • We propose VariReal, an automated generation pipeline for producing minimal-change synthetic data by altering only one attribute from real images at a time. This approach can be applied out-of-the-box to any objectcentric classification dataset without additional finetuning. • We define and generate feasible and infeasible dataset comparison pairs based on real images, covering three controlled attributes. • To explore feasible and infeasible data roles, we fine-tune CLIP with LoRA <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Analyzing classification scores, we offer new insights into the impact of feasibility and the strategic use of synthetic data for enhancing downstream classification performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Effect of out-of-distribution data. OOD data, defined relative to in-distribution data, introduces a distribution shift between train and test data. OOD data is generally categorized into semantic and covariance shifts <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>; here, we focus on covariance shifts. The impact of OOD data is commonly evaluated using classification tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</p><p>Early works <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> attributed OOD data's benefits to feature invariance and the stochasticity it adds in gradient descent, helping avoid local minima and improving optimization. However, this conclusion was drawn only using simple OOD data types like rotation. Silva et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and Geiping et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> show that, for small domain shifts, adding OOD data reduces generalization error on the original test set and exhibits non-monotonic behavior. While most research has relied on basic models (e.g., ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>) and datasets (e.g., MNIST <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>), our work seeks to produce OOD data study to more complex scenarios with diffusion models, utilizing advanced classification architectures to deepen the understanding of OOD effects.</p><p>Learning with synthetic data. Several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref>] focus on generating synthetic data that approximates real-world distributions. These approaches aim to create a dataset larger than the few-shot samples. Generated data supports various tasks, including object recogni- tion <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>, object detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and semantic segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by training CLIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> models exclusively on synthetic data or in combination with real data <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. As a result, we focus specifically on object classification using CLIP model. Automatic approach for minimal change generation. Unlike synthetic data generation methods that focus on creating novel and diverse in-distribution images <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, minimal change generation aims only to modify specific areas or attributes of existing real images. Generative models, particularly diffusion-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>, facilitate efficient image editing without requiring manual annotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> or physical graphics engines <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. In particular, text-to-image stable diffusion methods are popular for minimal-change editing due to their high fidelity generation. Beyond text guidance, these models also support diverse conditioning inputs, such as reference images through IP-Adaptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> and Canny edge maps through Control-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>.</p><p>These methods fall into two main categories: finetuning needed approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>, and non-fine-tuning needed approaches such as attention-or mask-based diffusion methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. Fine-tuned methods, such as In-structPix2Pix <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, require model retraining to achieve desired edits across new input domains. In contrast, attentionand mask-based diffusion models can target specific modifications without further fine-tuning. Attention-based methods, like FPE <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and P2P <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, substitute certain selfor cross-attention layers in the U-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>'s denoising process, leveraging the interpretability of attention maps. However, these methods may not perform well in all scenarios, particularly with real images <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Mask-based diffusion models, such as inpainting methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>, offer strong generalization and method versatility by enabling controlled edits within specified areas while preserving unmasked regions. However, when modifying objects itself, these models may occasionally alter subtle shape details. Methods like ControlNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> can help maintain an object's original structure during edits.</p><p>The most closely related work is VisMin <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, which generates minimal-change data to improve vision-language model comprehension. However, VisMin does not support controlled edits across our targeted three attributes. In contrast, we introduce an automatic, off-the-shelf approach enabling minimal, photorealistic edits for arbitrary combinations of real images and textual instructions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Preliminaries</head><p>Task formulation.</p><p>Our goal is to analyze the impact of feasible and infeasible synthetic data (I Syn ), with feasibility defined per individual class c i , where i ∈ 1, . . . , C. Our VariReal method generates minimal-change I Syn pairs from a shared real-image base (I Real ) using distinct textual prompts. Our approach isolates feasibility across three targeted attribute categories-background, color, and texture-while minimally altering other image content (e.g., the same dog depicted with different colors). The textual guidances are class-specific, LLM-generated prompts categorized as feasible (P f ) and infeasible (P if ). Each real image (I Real ) is combined with all prompts from both categories, ensuring every real image is repeated equally,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">|P f | = |P if |.</formula><p>By varying the number of prompts (|P f | ≥ 1), we assess the impact of additional synthetic augmentations. Note that the texture attribute inherently includes color characteristics. Finally, we LoRA fine-tune CLIP models on in-distribution and OOD synthetic datasets to compare how each data type influences downstream classification performance. Fine-tuning with low-rank adaptation. The Low-Rank Adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>  pre-trained weight matrix to reduce the number of learnable parameters. The final weights after fine-tuning could be expressed by h = W 0 x + BAx, where W 0 represents the pre-trained weights. The decomposed weights B ∈ R d×r and A ∈ R r×k , with LoRA rank r ≪ min(d, k). Latent diffusion models. Latent Stable Diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> encodes an image into a latent space using an encoder, defined as z 0 = E(x 0 ), and learns a conditional distribution p(z|c) by predicting the Gaussian noise added to the latent vector. The objective function can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">min θ E (x,c)∼D, ϵ∼N (0,1), t ∥ϵ − ϵ θ (z t , c, t)∥ 2 2 (1)</formula><p>where z t is the noisy latent representation, c is corresponding conditions and ϵ represents the Gaussian noise added at each time step t. For the inference process, a randomly noised vector is sampled and denoised over total T steps to obtain the final latent representation z 0 , which is then decoded back into pixel space using the decoder D(z 0 ) of the VAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. A naive solution. Naive solutions could employ textguided Inpainting models <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> (e.g., SDXL Inpainting) or Canny-edge-based ControlNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> models (e.g., SDXL ControlNet), using a base prompt P base = "a photo of a [CLS]". Inpainting methods generate more natural images but are heavily influenced by the original attributes, limiting their effectiveness for substantial changes, as illustrated by the persistent dark hue when changing a black car's color of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 (c)</ref>.</p><p>Conversely, ControlNet preserves object structure independently from original attributes in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (d) but often produces less natural edits for color and texture and can cause objects to appear floating when modifying backgrounds, reducing realism. Motivation. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we design a pipeline which overcomes the individual weaknesses of out-of-the-box methods by combining the individual strengths, i.e. combining Inpainting's realism with ControlNet's preciseness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">VariReal: Generating minimal-change data</head><p>We present a zero-shot pipeline for minimal-change image generation. Sec. 3.2.1 details prompt generation P f and P if , followed by our prior-based generation process in Sec. 3.2.2, including key steps like guidance maps and final processing. We also compare candidate models to determine the optimal modification strategy. Lastly, Sec. 3.2.3 covers MLLM-based filtering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Guidance prompt</head><p>P f and P if are as text prompts for Stable Diffusion model to guide desired content. To generate as many accurate P f and P if per fine-grained class as possible, we utilize ChatGPT-4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> with In-Context Learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, providing the model with positive examples Example+ and negative examples Example− to help avoid errors and repetitive content. To improve the fine-grained detail and realism of the generated backgrounds or textures, we instruct GPT to append a brief explanatory description when generating prompts, providing more detailed guidance for image generation.</p><p>Although large language models possess broad knowledge across various domains, ChatGPT still regularly designates attributes as 'feasible' for a target object that do not exist in the real world, particularly for fine-grained classes for which it has limited knowledge. For example, fine-grained airplane class "737-500" normally do not have color in purple. To address this issue, we design additional prompts to instruct the model to perform preliminary checks and filtering on its outputs. Manual verification ensures that feasible prompts align with the training domain. Using the same base prompt and ChatGPT-generated results, we form our final prompts shown in the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Prior-guided minimal change generation</head><p>Guidance map generation. The guided mask and canny images are for inpainting model and ControlNet respectively. We use Grounding DINO <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> to generate bounding boxes bbox i , which are then fed into the SAM2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> model to produce masks m i for each category c i . For samples without detectable bounding boxes, we use the RMBG1.4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> foreground segmentation model as a fallback to ensure each sample has a mask.</p><p>In our method, we use the Canny image ControlNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> model. For all settings, the Canny image is created by extracting the foreground Foreground i from mask i . Prior generation and process. We use prompts P f or P if with Stable Diffusion to generate "Background" and "Texture" Priors, and predefined RGB values from a Color Bank for the "Color Prior". These initial outputs are termed Raw Priors.</p><p>To integrate these priors with real images, we merge the original object's region with the Background Prior, applying mask dilation to preserve spatial context and realism (e.g., ensuring pets remain grounded). We ablate this operation effect in the Supplementary Sec. H. For color and texture edits, the generated prior is overlaid via an alpha channel to retain the original shape and details of the subject. These refined results are referred to as Real Priors. The Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 (a-b</ref>) illustrate these Priors. ControlNet leverages both Raw and Real Priors as conditions via IP-Adaptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, whereas Inpainting exclusively employs Real Prior to retain unchanged original information. Final process.</p><p>Before outputting the final images, the last step involves copying invariant regions from the original image and pasting them onto the generated image, ensuring minimal alterations. Minimal change for background. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (e) demonstrates that incorporating prior information significantly enhances background editing quality, fulfilling our minimalchange requirement. Our optimal results are obtained using Inpainting with the Real Prior, a background-region mask, and the corresponding prompt P shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Minimal change for foreground. In contrast, color and texture edits require foreground modifications. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (e-g), single-stage Inpainting and ControlNet models are insufficient under either Raw or Real Priors: Inpainting may distort object shapes, while ControlNet can produce unnatural results. To address this, we first produce an initial refined image using SDXL Inpainting, then use it as a conditional input for ControlNet to generate the final image. This combined approach (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>) leverages the strengths of both methods, preserving the object's shape while achieving natural and precise color or texture changes.</p></div>

We apply LoRA <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> modules to fine-tune both CLIP's image and text encoders. For each class c i ∈ C, we use the prompt "a photo of [CLS]" as text input.

Our synthetic data for background, color, and texture modifications require images with clearly defined foreground objects and visible backgrounds; hence, datasets dominated by foreground-only images, such as ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, are unsuitable. Fine-grained datasets offer clearer comparisons between feasible and infeasible attribute variations. Therefore, we generate our minimalchange synthetic datasets from three fine-grained sources: Oxford Pets <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, FGVC Aircraft <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, and Stanford Cars <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Additionally, to specifically evaluate background modifications, we use the binary classification WaterBirds dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which pairs landbirds and waterbirds with water or land backgrounds.

Our VariReal pipeline utilizes SDXL Inpainting v0.1 and SDXL ControlNet v1.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> based on Canny-edge conditioning, along with Stable Diffusion v2.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> for prior image generation in background and texture modifications. The Llava-1.6-7B <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> model is employed for automatic filtering.

The scale factor λ is set to 0.5 to equally weight real and synthetic cross-entropy losses. To ensure fair training budget despite varying dataset sizes (real-only, synthetic-only, and mixed synth+real training), we fix the total maximum training iterations to ensure same optimizer update steps. Detailed generation and training hyperparameters are provided in the Supplementary Sec. B. Baseline methods. To evaluate the impact of feasible versus infeasible synthetic data, we use zero-shot CLIP and CLIP fine-tuned on real images as baselines. We compare these baselines with CLIP trained exclusively on synthetic data and on combinations of synthetic and real data. Evaluation protocol. We measure classification performance using top-1 accuracy (%). For dataset distribution analysis in Sec. 4.3.2, we report FID <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, CLIP score <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, DINO score <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, and LPIPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> scores.

Specifically, in the AirC <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> dataset, feasible data outperforms infeasible by 1.8% under the background setting, while infeasible data performs better by 0.8% and 0.3% under the color and texture settings, respectively. After incorporating real data (real + synthetic), 78% of ∆ 1 values (5/9) remain within 0.3%, indicating that the performance gap between feasible and infeasible data is consistently small across settings.</p><p>Observation 1: Although feasible images perform slightly better, feasibility shows no clear impact on classification performance.</p></div>

For instance, in the synthetic-only setting, feasible and infeasible color data achieve 89.0% and 89.1% average performance, both below the real-only fine-tuning baseline of 90.8%. Even when combined with real data, color edits perform slightly worse by 0.1% and 0.2%.</p><p>In contrast, background modifications consistently improve performance. For instance, under synthetic-only training, feasible and infeasible backgrounds yield average accuracy gains of 1.2% and 0.6%, respectively, and 1.6% and 1.7% in the real + synthetic setting.</p><p>We further validate the benefits of background modifications on the WaterBirds <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> dataset (see Supplementary Sec.

Both feasible and infeasible background edits outperform real-only setting, with improvements of 0.9% and 6.7% respectively in the synthetic-only setting, and 7.2% and 8.8% in the real + synthetic setting.</p><p>Observation 2: Compared to fine-tuning on real data alone, adding synthetic data with background modifications improves performance, whereas synthetic foreground edits (color and texture) are less effective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3.">The role of mixed training</head><p>To assess the effect of mixing feasible and infeasible data, we construct a balanced synthetic dataset (third column of each subtable in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>), with a total size five times that of the real training set. We define the metric</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∆ 2 = Mix − F +IF 2</formula><p>to measure the performance gain from mixing, relative to the average of using feasible and infeasible data separately.</p><p>In the real + synthetic setting, mixed training yields comparable performance, with average ∆ 2 deviations within 0.2%. In contrast, under the synthetic-only setting, mixing leads to greater gains-0.4%, 0.2%, and 0.7% improvements on average for background, color, and texture edits-indicating stronger complementarity between feasible and infeasible data. Further analysis for this is provided in Supplementary Sec. F. This suggests that, unlike ALIA <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, modifications need not be strictly feasible.</p><p>Observation 3: It is not necessary to strictly generate only feasible synthetic images to achieve performance gain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Analysis of minimally changed data 4.3.1. Qualitative results</head><p>To assess the quality of VariReal-generated images, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> presents qualitative examples from all three datasets. These examples demonstrate that the edits follow the text prompts with minimal changes and align with our feasibility definition-existing in real world. For instance, "neon pink" is not a released color for the "Audi RS 4 Convertible 2008" and is thus treated as infeasible. The images show the expected modification, while the rest of the image remains unchanged from the real source. More examples are provided in Supplementary Sec. G.</p><p>To further validate image quality, we conducted a user study with six human annotators using a questionnaire. Evaluators assessed each image on two aspects: (1) feasibility-whether feasible images appear realistic and infeasible ones do not-and (2) naturalness, rated on a 1-5 scale, where 5 indicates the most natural appearance. More de-tails about the scoring setup are included in Supplementary Sec. G.</p><p>Feasibility is central to our pipeline, ensuring a clear distinction between feasible and infeasible subsets. As shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, feasibility correctness is high, with error rates below 8% for feasible and 16% for infeasible data. The slightly lower accuracy for infeasible cases stems from occasional mismatched background-object combinations and difficulty capturing fine-grained texture details-particularly in the AirC dataset, as noted in annotator feedback (see Supplementary Sec. G). These results support the effectiveness of our approach, with VariReal reliably generating high-quality edits, further refined by automatic filtering (Sec. 3.2.3).</p><p>Regarding how natural the generated images are, VariReal images received acceptable naturalness scores from human annotators-averaging 3.94 for feasible and 3.96 for infeasible data. For failure cases, some generated images appear less natural (see Supplementary Sec. G) because of a dramatic change from the original color to a new color, such as red to white.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">Distribution analysis</head><p>We analyze the dataset using several similarity metrics to better understand the distributional differences between feasible and infeasible data and their relation to in-and out-ofdistribution. We compute the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> to quantify the distributional similarity between generated and real data. Additionally, we use: CLIP Score: calculated cosine similarity for feature from the ViT-L/14 model <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. DINO Score: computed cosine similarity for feature from the DINOv2-Base model <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> for feature extraction.

This observation is supported by the metrics in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, which reports average scores across the three datasets. All three metrics indicate that feasible data is closer to real data. While CLIP and DINO scores show limited sensitivity to fine-grained differences, LPIPS captures subtle variations more effectively.</p><p>Interestingly, both feasible and infeasible foreground modifications (color and texture) are closer to real data than background edits. For instance, in the AirC <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> dataset, FID peak scores for foreground edits are much lower (around 95 and 110 for feasible/infeasible) than for background edits (around 170 and 220).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3.">Scaling the number of training images</head><p>To further understand the impact of synthetic data by VariReal, we conducted a scaling analysis on the AirC dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, adjusting feasible/infeasible synthetic-to-real ratios from 1:1 to 5:1. Our results in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> reveal a nonlinear relationship between performance and data scale. While background modifications always benefit the downstream tasks, color and texture modifications achieve peak accuracy at smaller scales. Notably, performance slightly exceeds the baseline at these peaks but declines as more synthetic images are Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>.</p><p>The scaling experiment results for the FGVC-Aircraft <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> dataset are shown for background, color, and texture settings. The horizontal axis represents the scale factor for synthetic images relative to real images. Here, the total real image training set is used, with scale factors ranging from 1 to 5.</p><p>added. This indicates that both feasible and infeasible color and texture data behave similar to OOD data, while feasible data being relatively closer to the real distribution. Large-scale use of such data does not provide meaningful in-distribution information for downstream tasks. However, a limited amount can serve as effective augmentation, enhancing model performance and robustness.</p><p>Observation 5: Synthetic data with color and texture modifications can enhance classification performance as augmentation, but their effectiveness is limited to specific scaling ranges. In contrast, background modifications consistently yield performance gains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this work, we present VariReal, a pipeline for systematically investigating the impact of minimal-change feasible and infeasible synthetic data. By introducing controlled variations in background, color, and texture across three fine-grained datasets, we assess the role of feasibility through LoRA-based fine-tuning of a CLIP classifier. Our findings reveal a counter-intuitive result: feasibility does not significantly affect classification performance. Although typically assumed to benefit downstream tasks, feasible synthetic variations in color and texture are no more effective than real data-and in some cases, even degrade performance. In contrast, background modifications consistently improve accuracy, regardless of feasibility. This suggests that, for object-centric classification, altering foreground attributes may disrupt class-relevant signals and yield limited gains. Overall, our results underscore the nuanced effects of different attribute modifications and offer new insights for designing effective synthetic data generation strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Does Feasibility Matter? Understanding the Impact of Feasibility on Synthetic Training Data</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Material</head><p>In this supplementary material, we first discuss the broader impacts and limitations of our analysis in Sec. A. Experimental setups for our method are provided in Sec. B, and configurations for other image editing models are detailed in Sec. C. Sec. D describes our method in detail, including guidance prompts and automatic filtering. Additionally, we present background-specific classification results on the WaterBird <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> dataset in Sec. E. Further classification result analysis is provided in Sec. F, followed by additional qualitative examples and user study details in Sec. G. Finally, an ablation study of the VariReal pipeline is included in Sec. H.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Broader Impact and Limitation</head><p>Our VariReal pipeline focuses on generating feasible and infeasible image pairs for downstream tasks, with potential applications beyond classification. It offers a robust method for modifying backgrounds, colors, and textures in both prompts and real images, making it suitable for image editing tasks that require precise changes while preserving other regions. VariReal can also serve as a dataset generation tool to fine-tune Stable Diffusion models for text-guided image editing, enabling targeted modifications. Additionally, it supports data augmentation, showing that augmenting both feasible and infeasible backgrounds improves classification performance-unlike ALIA <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which only uses feasible backgrounds.</p><p>We define feasibility as alignment with real-world plausibility. For instance, feasible car colors are those officially released by manufacturers. Rare custom paint jobs-such as a "cyan" Audi RS 4 Convertible 2008-are excluded, as they do not reflect typical production offerings. Within our scope, such extreme cases are treated as infeasible settings.</p><p>Our approach targets datasets with clear foregroundbackground separation and focuses on classification tasks under minimal-change settings. Although we strive to preserve structure, slight deviations-particularly in color and texture edits-are sometimes unavoidable due to current image editing limitations. In the meantime, our method requires adjusting hyperparameters when modifying images to meet specific requirements. We believe advances in image editing techniques will make our experimental setup more effective and easier to implement. Due to resource constraints, we explored only three attributes (background, color, texture), but future work could extend to others, such as lighting. Developing a unified method for minimal, single-step edits across multiple attributes would en-hance scalability and enable broader application to diverse datasets and tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Implementation Details</head><p>We provide additional implementation details for VariReal in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>. Key parameters include noise strength for the SDXL Inpainting model <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and conditioning strength for IP-Adapter <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> with ControlNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. Due to varying difficulty across datasets and between feasible and infeasible generation, we use dataset-specific settings.</p><p>Following DataDream <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, we tune learning rates and weight decay for classification tasks. We use a batch size of 64, AdamW <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> optimizer, and a cosine annealing scheduler. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> lists the CLIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> fine-tuning parameters. Learning rates and weight decay are selected from a predefined range based on validation performance. The number of training iterations is fixed as described in Sec. 4.1, with dataset-specific counts provided in the table.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Other Image Editing Method Setups</head><p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we compare VariReal with In-structPix2Pix <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and FPE <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. To ensure fairness and leverage each model's strengths, we follow their original usage guidelines. For FPE, we maintain aspect ratio via resizing and padding, and use the original training setup with recommended prompts-e.g., "a [CLS] in the [ATTRIBUTE] background" for background changes and "a [ATTRIBUTE] [CLS]" for color or texture edits, where [CLS] denotes the class name and [ATTRIBUTE] refers to feasible or infeasible prompts from Sec. 3.2.1. InstructPix2Pix uses prompts like "put it in [ATTRIBUTE] background" for background changes and "make it a [ATTRIBUTE] aircraft" for foreground edits. We conducted multiple trials and selected the best outputs for comparison.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D. Method Details D.1. Guidance prompt</head><p>As detailed in Sec. 3.2.1 and shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, the prompt generation process includes initial prompt generation and preliminary checks.</p><p>Specifically, we use GPT-4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to generate feasible or infeasible initial attributes (prompt words), which are then combined into a final prompt using our template: "a photo of a [CLS]", as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>. These initial attributes are then preliminarily checked by:  For example, "deep cave" is not a feasible background for the pets class in the initial generation results and is filtered out by GPT-4. To ensure feasible attributes align with the training set, we manually check the existing backgrounds, colors, and textures in the training data and remove those absent from it. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows the acceptance ratio at each stage.</p><p>An example of generated attributes is the following, where the placeholders [ATTRIBUTE] represents the feasible/infeasible background, color, or texture, and [CLASS] represents a specific class. Here we also give one specific example for generating feasible and infeasible background for Oxford Pets dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> after replacing the placeholders in the above template in Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>. By using the prompts described above, we also select some generated attributes (prompt words) to replace the placeholder in the prompt template. Due to space limitations, we provide up to five attributes as an example for the Oxford Pets <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> dataset. Some generated feasible and infeasible prompt words can be found in Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.2. Automatic filtering</head><p>As introduced in Sec. 3.2.3, we present the filtering questions for background, color, and texture changes. These checks ensure that the generated attributes align with the text prompt. For background attributes, we also verify if the foreground objects are feasible within the given background. Using placeholders for each background, color, texture prompt, object class, and feasibility information, we formulate questions based on the following filtering question template.</p></div>

Notably, infeasible background edits improve performance by 5.8 percentage points in the synthetic-only setting and 1.6 percentage points in the real + synthetic setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F. Classification Results Analysis</head><p>In Sec. 4.2.1, we analyze mixing the feasible and infeasible data has no clear impact on classification tasks but some times will help the model learn complementary knowledge. We evaluate prediction correctness per test sample to compare knowledge learned by models trained under different settings. To measure whether one model's correctly predicted set is a subset of another's, we use: Inclusion Coefficient = |A∩B| |A| , with values closer to 1 indicating greater overlap. Additionally, we quantify the overlap of correctly predicted samples between models using the Jaccard index:J(A, B) = |A∩B| |A∪B| , where A and B, where A and B represent correct predictions from two training configurations.</p><p>The Inclusion matrix in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">15</ref> shows no subset relationship exists between model predictions.Notably, the feasible-only and infeasible-only settings labeled with dashed lines yield the lowest Jaccard scores, indicating minimal similarity.</p><p>Observation: The feasible and infeasible data lead the model to learn different directions, while they achieve very similar performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>G. Qualitative Examples and User Study</head><p>We provide additional qualitative examples to demonstrate the generation quality of our VariReal method. One additional example from the Oxford Pets <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, FGVC Aircraft <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, and Stanford Cars <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> datasets is included, along with one randomly selected example across these datasets.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">11</ref> shows the Abyssinian pet generation results, where our VariReal method produces more detailed backgrounds, such as "active war zone."

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">13</ref> features a BMW X3 SUV 2012 example. Finally, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">16</ref> provides randomly selected examples from the three datasets for further visualization. The instruction for the questionnaire is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">17</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">18</ref> presents examples of correctly and incorrectly classified feasibility cases. More detail can be seen by zooming into the figures. For infeasible texture modifications, failure cases often like infeasible texture change of fish scale or brick wall, which are fine-grained and hard to represent clearly. In such cases, the output may only reflect the color rather than the intended texture, so human evaluators will classify these to the incorrect cases. Another source of error involves implausible object-background combinations-for example, a "flying aircraft in an airplane hangar" shown in the lower part of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">18</ref>.</p><p>For the naturalness criterion, some images-such as those in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">19</ref> where the feasible color is changed from red to gray or white-receive lower scores, as the resulting colors appear less natural.  </p></div>
