<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Vector graphics, especially in the form of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), play an essential role in digital arts such as icons, clipart, and graphic design. By representing visual elements as geometric shapes, SVGs provide resolution independence, compact file sizes, and flexibility for layer-wise manipulation, making them highly favored by designers. Given the challenges of creating high-quality vector graphics, many recent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Jain et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Thamizharasan et al. 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Wu et al. 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Xing et al. 2024]</ref> have proposed algorithms in text-to-vector (T2V) generation. However, these methods overlook an important need in practical applications -style customization. Designers often customize a set of vector graphics with consistent visual appearance and aesthetic coherence. This is crucial for ensuring design quality, particularly in contexts like branding, user interfaces, and themed illustrations.</p><p>Simply extending existing T2V methods for style customization is difficult. Current T2V methods can be categorized into optimization-based and feed-forward methods. Optimization-based T2V methods, which either optimize a set of vector elements (e.g., cubic Bézier curves) to fit the images generated by T2I models <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Ma et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Zhang et al. 2023b]</ref>, or directly optimize shape parameters using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[Poole et al. 2022]</ref> based on T2I models <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Jain et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Xing et al. 2023b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Zhang et al. 2024]</ref>, can be extended for style customization by fine-tuning a T2I model on user-provided style examples. Although effective in adapting to new styles, these methods are time-consuming and often produce fragmented or cluttered paths. Such outputs overlook the inherent structural regularity and element relationships within SVG designs, making them difficult to edit or refine further.</p><p>Feed-forward T2V methods, on the other hand, are trained on SVG datasets using large language models (LLMs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[Rodriguez et al. 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Wu et al. 2023]</ref> or diffusion models <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[Thamizharasan et al. 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Xing et al. 2024]</ref>, maintaining SVG regularity and attaining high-quality outcomes within their respective training domains. However, style customization of the T2V model presents significant challenges. The absence of large-scale, general-purpose text-SVG datasets makes it difficult for the T2V model to disentangle content and style semantics, limiting its ability to generalize to new styles. Consequently, a straightforward approach of fine-tuning a base T2V model with only a few exemplar SVGs, following T2I customization techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[Hu et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kumari et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ruiz et al. 2022]</ref>, often leads to overfitting on the exemplar SVGs. Nevertheless, acquiring a sufficient number of consistent style sample SVGs for fine-tuning is impractical due to the scarcity of such data.</p><p>Addressing these limitations, we propose a novel two-stage style customization pipeline for SVG generation using only a few exemplar SVGs. It combines the strengths of feed-forward T2V methods to ensure SVG structural regularity and T2I models to acquire powerful customization capabilities. In the first stage, we train a T2V model on black-and-white SVG datasets to focus on learning the contents and structures of SVGs. In the second stage, we learn various styles of SVGs by distilling priors from different customized T2I models. Our two-stage pipeline also helps the T2V model explicitly disentangle content and style semantics.</p><p>The aim of the first stage is to train a T2V generative model tailored for style customization. Considering that LLM-based methods generate SVG code in an autoregressive manner, limiting their ability to utilize raster images as supervision, we adopt a diffusion model as the base model to enable customization from the T2I model. As for the representation, global SVG-level representations <ref type="bibr">[Xing et al. 2024]</ref> suffer from limited expressivity constrained by the dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[Rombach et al. 2022]</ref>, and point-level representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[Thamizharasan et al. 2024</ref>] are inefficient for complex SVGs. Thus, we select a path-level representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[Zhang et al. 2024</ref>] that ensures both compactness and expressivity. In this stage, our path-level T2V diffusion model learns to generate SVGs that feature text-aligned content and exhibit structural regularity.</p><p>In the second stage, we distill styles from a T2I diffusion model to enable style customization for the T2V diffusion model. Specifically, we fine-tune the T2I model using a small set of style images to generate diverse customized images, which serve as augmented data for training the T2V model. To facilitate image-based training, we employ a reparameterization technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[Song et al. 2020]</ref> to compute SVG predictions and render them as images, enabling the T2V model to be updated via an image-level loss. After training, the T2V model can generate SVGs in learned custom styles corresponding to text prompts in a feed-forward manner.</p><p>We evaluate our method through comprehensive experiments across vector-level, image-level, and text-level metrics. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in generating high-quality vector graphics with valid SVG structures and diverse customized styles, given input text prompts. Examples of style customization results produced by our framework are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Our key contributions are:</p><p>• We propose a novel two-stage T2V pipeline to disentangle content and style in SVG generation, which is also the first feedforward T2V model capable of generating SVGs in custom styles. • We design a T2V diffusion model based on path-level representations, ensuring structural regularity of SVGs while maintaining diverse expressive capabilities. • We develop a style customization method for the T2V model by distilling styles from customized image diffusion models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">SVG Representation</head><p>An SVG can be represented as a set of paths, denoted as 𝑆𝑉 𝐺 = {𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ 1 , 𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ 2 , . . . , 𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ 𝑚 }. A parametric path can be defined as a series of cubic Bézier curves connected end-to-end and filled with a uniform color 𝑐, represented as 𝑃𝑎𝑡ℎ 𝑖 = (𝑝 1 , 𝑝 2 , . . . , 𝑝 𝑑 , 𝑐), where {𝑝 𝑗 } 𝑑 𝑗=1 are the 𝑑 control points used to define the cubic Bézier curves. In contrast to recent approaches that use global SVG-level representations <ref type="bibr">[Xing et al. 2024]</ref>, which are constrained in expressivity by the limitations of the SVG dataset, or pointlevel representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[Thamizharasan et al. 2024</ref>], which become inefficient for complex SVGs, we adopt a path-level representation that balances compactness and expressivity.</p><p>T2V-NPR <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[Zhang et al. 2024</ref>] introduced a path-level SVG VAE designed to effectively capture common shape patterns and geometric constraints within its latent space, ensuring smooth path outputs. Following the methodology of T2V-NPR, we leverage a pre-trained SVG VAE to encode the 𝑑 control points of each path into a latent vector 𝑧 𝑖 . This latent vector is then combined with the associated color 𝐶 𝑖 and transformation parameters 𝑇𝑟 𝑖 for the 𝑖-th path, denoted as P 𝑖 = (𝑧 𝑖 , 𝐶 𝑖 ,𝑇𝑟 𝑖 ). Using this path-level representation, an SVG tensor can be represented as a sequence of 𝑚 paths in the latent space, denoted as s 0 = (P 1 , P 2 , . . . , P 𝑚 ), where s 0 ∈ R 𝑑 𝑃 ×𝑚 and 𝑑 𝑃 is the dimension of the path embeddings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Vector Denoiser</head><p>The vector denoiser is trained to reverse a Gaussian diffusion process, enabling the generation of SVG tensors from noisy inputs. In the forward diffusion process, Gaussian noise is progressively added to a sample SVG tensor s 0 over 𝑇 time steps, ultimately transforming it into a unit Gaussian noise s 𝑇 ∼ N (0, I) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Ho et al. 2020]</ref>. At each time step 𝑡 ∈ {1, 2, . . . ,𝑇 }, the vector denoiser predicts the noise content 𝝐 𝜃 to be removed from the noisy SVG representation s 𝑡 .</p><p>Model Architecture. We adopt a transformer architecture based on DiT <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[Peebles and Xie 2023]</ref> as the backbone for our vector denoiser. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>(a), the model takes the noisy tensor s 𝑡 as input and is conditioned on both the text prompt y and the time step 𝑡. Each transformer block consists of self-attention, crossattention, and feed-forward layers. The text prompt y is encoded into feature embeddings using the CLIP text encoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[Radford et al. 2021</ref>], which interact with vector features through cross-attention similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Chen et al. 2023</ref>]. Time step embeddings are injected via adaptive layer normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Chen et al. 2024]</ref> in each transformer block.</p><p>Training Objective. The training of the T2V diffusion model follows the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Ho et al. 2020]</ref>. At each time step 𝑡, Gaussian noise 𝝐 ∼ N (0, I) is added to the original SVG tensor s 0 , resulting in a noisy representation s 𝑡 = √ ᾱ𝑡 s 0 + √ 1 − ᾱ𝑡 𝝐, where ᾱ𝑡 is a time-dependent coefficient controlling the noise level. The vector denoiser is trained to predict the added noise 𝝐 in s 𝑡 , conditioned on the text prompt y and the time step 𝑡. The training objective is to minimize the 𝐿 2 distance between the predicted noise 𝝐 𝜃 and the actual noise 𝝐:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L DM = E s 0 ,y,𝝐,𝑡 ∥𝝐 − 𝝐 𝜃 (s 𝑡 , 𝑡, y)∥ 2 2 .</formula><p>(1)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Training Details</head><p>We train our T2V diffusion model using the FIGR-8-SVG dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Clouâtre and Demers 2019]</ref>, which consists of black-and-white vector icons. By eliminating stylistic variations, this dataset enables the model to focus on learning the structures and semantics of SVGs in the first stage. To preprocess the data, we follow the same steps as IconShop <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[Wu et al. 2023</ref>] to obtain valid SVG data and their corresponding text descriptions. Examples from the dataset are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>(a). For the raw SVG data, we convert all other primitive shapes (e.g., lines, rectangles and ellipses) into cubic Bézier curves, which are encoded as path embeddings as described in Section 4.1. Since the number of paths varies across SVGs, we pad the sequences of path tensors with zeros to a fixed length of 32 and filter out SVGs with more paths. This results in 210,000 samples for model training. In our implementation, we set 𝑑 𝑃 = 28 and 𝑚 = 32 for the SVG representation and normalize the SVG embeddings to the range of [−1, 1]. The model architecture consists of 28 transformer blocks, a hidden dimension of 800, and 12 attention heads. We configure the number of diffusion steps to 𝑇 = 1000 and employ a cosine noise schedule <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Ho et al. 2020]</ref>. During training, we apply classifier-free guidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[Ho and Salimans 2022]</ref> by randomly zeroing the text prompt y with a probability of 10%. We use the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 3 × 10 −5 . The T2V diffusion network is trained for 3000 epochs with a batch size of 64, taking approximately 6 days on 8 A6000 GPUs.</p><p>After the first stage of training, our T2V diffusion model generates high-quality SVGs that align with text prompts while maintaining the structural integrity of the SVGs.

To enable the model to produce images in desired styles, we fine-tune a base T2I diffusion model "SD-v1-5" checkpoint<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , using a small set of style reference images. to train the student model, we apply a similar approach to generate customized images as guidance for training. Given a text prompt y, we randomly sample Gaussian noise 𝝐 and input both into the T2V model. The T2V model performs DDPM denoising process to generate an SVG representation s 𝑔 0 , which is then passed through a pre-trained path decoder <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[Zhang et al. 2024</ref>] and a differentiable rasterizer R <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[Li et al. 2020]</ref> to produce an image 𝐼 𝑔 0 = R (𝐷𝑒𝑐 (s 𝑔 0 )). At this stage, 𝐼 𝑔 0 is a black-and-white style image. To ensure that the guidance image generated by the T2I model aligns with the structure of 𝐼 𝑔 0 without significant deviations, we integrate Con-trolNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[Zhang et al. 2023a</ref>] into the customized T2I model. This ensures overall structural alignment between the customized image 𝐼 𝑐 0 and 𝐼 𝑔 0 . By using the Canny edge map of 𝐼 𝑔 0 as a control image, we preserve the structural integrity of the original SVG while incorporating the desired style. Using this approach, we can generate the corresponding (s 𝑔 0 , 𝐼 𝑐 0 ) pair from random noise given a text prompt y, and fine-tune the T2V model with image-level loss.</p></div>

We set 𝜔 𝑡 = (1 − ᾱ𝑡 ) empirically, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Crowson et al. 2024</ref>].</p><p>The image loss guides the T2V model to predict SVGs that match the customized image, reflecting the desired style. Additionally, we incorporate the diffusion loss L DM defined on ŝ𝑔 0 , as described in Equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>, to help the model learn the new data distribution of the predicted SVGs ŝ𝑔 0 . Specifically, Gaussian noise is added to ŝ𝑔 0 , and the model predicts this noise, with the diffusion loss calculated using Equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>. During training, the T2V model is updated based on the combined loss function L = L img + L DM .</p><p>To enable our T2V diffusion model to generate SVGs in diverse custom styles, we select 200 distinct style reference sets from SV-GRepo 2 , iconfont<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref> and Freepik<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref> , each set containing a small collection of exemplar SVGs (ranging from 1 to 30 SVGs per set). We train the T2V model simultaneously across all 200 styles, with each style distinguished by a unique token "[𝑉 * ]". The training process lasts for 80K iterations with a batch size of 20, where each iteration generates 20 pairs of (s 𝑔 0 , 𝐼 𝑐 0 ) from randomly sampled text prompts and Gaussian noise across different styles. We employ a learning rate of 4 × 10 −6 , taking approximately 6 days using 8 A6000 GPUs.</p><p>After style fine-tuning, our T2V model can generate SVGs in the learned custom styles based on text prompts in a feed-forward manner.</p><p>Our method also supports fine-tuning on a single style or incrementally adding a new style with only a few exemplars via either full-model or LoRA fine-tuning. Similar to DreamBooth <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[Ruiz et al. 2022]</ref>, the former approach fine-tunes the full T2V model with a new style represented by a token "[𝑉 * ]" that is distinct from all existing style tokens. For a parameter-efficient alternative, we fine-tune external LoRA weights for the attention layers of DiT blocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[Hu et al. 2021</ref>], adapting the model to a new style without introducing an additional style token.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">EXPERIMENTS</head><p>Experiment Setup. To evaluate our method, we randomly select 5 text prompts from the FIGR-8-SVG dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Clouâtre and Demers 2019]</ref> for each of the 200 styles, resulting in a total of 1000 vector graphics. For each style, we append the special style token "in [𝑉 * ] style" to the respective text prompt. During testing, we use the DDPM sampler with 1000 steps and classifier-free guidance with a scale of 3 to achieve better results. Generating an SVG takes around 25 seconds on an NVIDIA-A6000.</p><p>Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate the quality of our results from vector-level, image-level, text-level perspectives. For vector-level evaluation, we use a path VAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[Zhang et al. 2024</ref>] trained on the FIGR-8-SVG dataset to encode SVG paths into latent vectors. We calculate the FID between these latents and the ground truth paths from FIGR-8-SVG, to evaluate how well the paths align with welldesigned vector graphics. For image-level evaluation, we evaluate the style alignment and the visual aesthetics of SVGs. We measure style alignment by calculating the average cosine similarity between ClIP image features of style references and rendered SVG images <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[Sohn et al. 2023</ref>]. We use the Aesthetic score <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[Schuhmann 2022</ref>] to evaluate the overall image quality. For text-level evaluation, we calculate the CLIP cosine similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[Radford et al. 2021</ref>] between the text prompt and the rendered SVGs to measure semantic alignment.</p><p>Baselines. We compare our proposed pipeline with two types of T2V generation schemes: optimization-based methods and feedforward methods.</p><p>Optimization-based methods rely on pre-trained T2I models, so we first perform style-tuning on T2I diffusion models using the method described in Section 5.1. For vectorization with T2I methods, we generate customized images and optimize the SVGs to fit the images using two distinct vectorization techniques: a traditional method, Potrace <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[Selinger 2003</ref>], and a deep learning-based method LIVE <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Ma et al. 2022]</ref>. For text-guided SVG optimization, we compare three approaches: VectorFusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Jain et al. 2022</ref>] using SDS loss, SVGDreamer <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[Xing et al. 2023b</ref>] and T2I-NPR <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[Zhang et al. 2024]</ref>, which use VSD loss. We use 64 paths for SVG optimization. To enhance alignment with the exemplar style, we begin by using the vectorized outputs from customized images as the initial SVGs.</p><p>Feed-forward methods include language-based and diffusionbased approaches. For the former, we use GPT-4o <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Achiam et al. 2023]</ref> to generate customized SVGs via providing curated in-context examples in the prompts. Specifically, we supply raster images and corresponding SVG scripts of the exemplar style and let GPT-4o act as an SVG code generator, to generate SVGs that match the style of the exemplars with the given text prompts. For the latter, since no diffusion-based T2V models are publicly available yet, we reproduce VecFusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[Thamizharasan et al. 2024]</ref> as a base T2V model. To achieve style customization, we compare two approaches: (1) an vector-based fine-tuning method, in which we fine-tune VecFusion with a small set of exemplar SVGs <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[Ruiz et al. 2022]</ref> <ref type="figure">;</ref> (2) a neural style transfer (NST) method for SVG <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Efimova et al. 2023</ref>], where we first generate an SVG using the base model, then select an exemplar SVG as the style reference and apply style transfer to the model's output.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Comparisons</head><p>We evaluate the performance of our method by comparing it with baselines qualitatively and quantitatively. The quantitative results are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> and the qualitative results are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref>. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>, our method outperforms the others from a comprehensive perspective.</p><p>Comparisons with Optimization-based Methods. Vectorization with T2I methods reconstruct customized images through colorbased image segmentation and curve fitting. However, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>(c), while Potrace <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[Selinger 2003</ref>] produces visually appealing outputs by faithfully reconstructing the customized images, it struggles with overly complex vector elements and lacks layer organization, as indicated by the higher Path FID in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>. This results in disorganized structures, reduced semantic clarity, and increased complexity in the SVGs. Such issues are common in image vectorization methods and contradict professional design principles, which prioritize simplicity and clarity in vector graphics. LIVE <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Ma et al. 2022</ref>] faces similar challenges, producing SVGs containing numerous irregular and broken paths. Zoomed-in illustrations in Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> highlight the issues of overcomplicated and fragmented paths (shown within green boxes).</p><p>Text-guided SVG optimization methods leverage score distillation in T2I diffusion models to optimize a set of shapes. VectorFusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Jain et al. 2022]</ref> and SVGDreamer <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[Xing et al. 2023b</ref>] directly optimize the control points of paths to generate text-conforming SVGs. However, due to the high degrees of freedom, the paths may undergo complex transformations that result in jagged and cluttered shapes, leading to visually unappealing outcomes. T2V-NPR <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[Zhang et al. 2024]</ref> tackles the issue of irregular paths by learning a latent representation of paths and reduces fragmentation by merging shapes with similar colors. However, while it produces smooth paths, it cannot guarantee the semantic integrity of the shapes, as the merging operation overlooks their semantic meaning. This can lead to semantically ambiguous paths, such as the merging of an owl's eye with its wing, as shown in the first row of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>.</p><p>Overall, optimization-based methods that rely only on image supervision overlook the inherent design principles and layer structure of SVGs. Consequently, the generated SVGs often contain redundant shapes and disorganized layers, making them difficult    to edit. Moreover, these methods are time-consuming due to their iterative optimization, typically requiring tens of minutes per SVG, which makes them impractical for real design scenarios. In contrast, our T2V diffusion model learns vector properties, such as valid path semantics and layer structure, by training on a well-designed SVG dataset. Our novel two-stage training strategy enables feedforward generation of well-structured SVGs in a few seconds, while achieving visually appealing results in diverse custom styles.</p><p>Comparisons with Feed-forward Methods. Regarding languagebased methods, though provided with in-context SVG examples, GPT-4o <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Achiam et al. 2023</ref>] can only generate simple combinations of basic primitive shapes (e.g., circles and rectangles) to align with text prompts, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>(a). It fails to produce the complex geometric details required for professional SVGs, resulting in outputs inadequate for graphic design.</p><p>Although the original VecFusion model <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[Thamizharasan et al. 2024]</ref>, trained on the FIGR-8-SVG dataset, generates high-quality</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ours</head><p>Potrace GPT-4o T2V-NPR VecFusion + NST results within its trained domains, it cannot be extended to style customization using existing methods. When applying an vectorbased fine-tuning approach, where VecFusion is fine-tuned with a small set of exemplar SVGs <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[Ruiz et al. 2022]</ref>, its limited generalization ability prevents it from generating semantically correct SVGs in new custom styles. Instead, the model overfits to the exemplar SVGs, simply reconstructing them rather than adapting to diverse prompts. As a result, the generated outputs exhibit high Style Alignment but poor Text Alignment in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>.</p><p>NST <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Efimova et al. 2023</ref>] applies style transfer to the SVGs generated by VecFusion using a style loss in image space. Although this method directly inherits the original layer-wise properties, the optimized SVGs often have messy visual appearances. Furthermore, it struggles to capture fine-grained style features, leading to poor style consistency.</p><p>In contrast, our method excels at adapting to the style, effectively capturing details from user-provided style, such as color schemes and design patterns. It achieves high visual quality while preserving the structure of the output SVGs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">User Study</head><p>We conducted a perceptual study to evaluate our style customization of T2V generation from three perspectives: overall SVG quality, style alignment and semantic alignment. We randomly selected 20 text prompts from the dataset and generated SVGs using both the baseline methods and our approach. Each question presented the results of different methods in a random order, and 30 participants were given unlimited time to select the best result among five options for each evaluation metric. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> demonstrates the superior performance of our method, as it achieves the highest preference in all evaluation metrics. Specifically, our method obtains 53.2% of votes for overall SVG quality, 51.8% for style alignment, and 51.7% for semantic alignment. The results show the effectiveness of our method in generating high-quality SVGs in custom styles from text prompts that align more closely with human perception.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Ablation Study</head><p>Ablation on SVG Representation. Instead of using our path-level representation for training the T2V diffusion model, another baseline is to use a global SVG-level representation. Following the Deep-SVG <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Carlier et al. 2020</ref>] architecture, we train a transformer-based VAE on the FIGR-8-SVG dataset, where all paths with their properties (including the path order, control points and color) are encoded into a single latent vector. We then replace our path-level representation with this SVG-level representation for T2V diffusion model  training and subsequent style distillation. However, the global SVGlevel representation is constrained by the geometry and color limitations of the dataset, which restricts its ability to generate SVGs in only a fixed style. As a result, it fails to adapt to new custom styles, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>(a). In contrast, our path-level representation maintains both compactness and expressivity, allowing for flexible and diverse SVG customizations.</p><p>Ablation on Style Customization with Image Diffusion Priors. We compare our image-based style customization method with a vectorbased fine-tuning approach. Specifically, in the second stage, we directly fine-tune our T2V model using a small set of exemplar SVGs, following the fine-tuning techniques of T2I diffusion models <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[Ruiz et al. 2022</ref>]. However, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>(b), this method leads to overfitting on the exemplar SVGs, causing the model to simply reconstruct them rather than aligning with the text semantics, as reflected by a high style alignment score and a low text alignment score in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>. In contrast, our style distillation method from image diffusion takes advantage of the strong visual priors in T2I diffusion models to generate customized images as augmented data, enabling diverse style customizations of SVGs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we present a novel two-stage pipeline for style customization of SVGs. Our approach disentangles content and style semantics in the T2V diffusion model, ensuring structural regularity and expressive diversity in the generated SVGs. By employing a path-level T2V diffusion model and distilling styles from T2I diffusion priors, our method produces high-quality SVGs in custom styles from text prompts in a feed-forward manner. While our method excels at SVG style customization, it has limitations. First, our T2V model is trained on the FIGR-8-SVG dataset, which contains only simple class labels, limiting the model's semantic understanding of SVG content. For example, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>(a), semantic elements like "cello" and "cupcake" are inaccurate when the text descriptions exceed the training domain's capacity. This could be mitigated with a larger and higher-quality SVG dataset with detailed annotations. Second, it may lose fine-grained stylistic details for overly complex style references, as depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>(b).</p><p>Our model can be used to synthesize SVG data, and with advanced diffusion model techniques, it enables flexible control and editing, which we plan to explore in future work.
