Various steps are involved in the Data Science life cycle such as business understanding, data preparation, data cleaning, visualization, modeling, and deployment. Let's go through these steps in detail Business understanding: Before processing data, it is important to understand what the problem is or the objectives the business wants to achieve. For example, if a business wants to reduce credit loss, then it needs to find out the factors that affect it. For this, we need to understand our data by its structure, sources, relevance, and its type. Data preparation: It is the most important step in the Data Science life cycle that involves data extraction, merging different data sources, cleaning, and dealing with missing values. Although it takes a lot of time to clean and transform the data, it is a crucial step to create a good model. Exploratory data analysis: Before building the actual model, we have to gather information about the possible solutions and the affecting factors. We have to find the best possible solution that provides suitable results after processing the data. Data modeling: The prepared data is fed to the data model, which provides the desired output. After selecting the model, we need to select the algorithm that provides the perfect results. To achieve the desired results, we can also use hyperparameters while maintaining a balance between generalization and performance. Model evaluation: After the model is trained and modified based on the requirements, it is tested by unused datasets and evaluation metrics. If the desired results are not achieved, we must re-iterate the model until it gets it right. Model deployment: Model deployment is the final step in the Data Science life cycle, where the model is deployed in the desired channel and format. After rigorous evaluation and modifications, the data model will become ready to provide the results in real time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1.3</head><p>What is an IDE? IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, brings all the different aspects of writing code under a single umbrellacode editor, compiler/interpreter, and debugger. IDEs make it easier to start programming new applications quickly without setting up different utilities and learning other tools to run a program. The debugger tool inside IDEs is a boon that helps us examine variables and inspect code. IDEs helps to isolate the error that is bothering our otherwise brilliant code. Some IDEs also give us the capability to unit test our code to ensure it runs in every scenario. IDEs also have intelligent auto-code completion recommendations to anticipate what we will type next. Although this can make us lazy programmers, it inevitably saves us time while writing Python programs. So, with that backdrop, let's start exploring the various Python IDEs and unravel the capabilities of each of them!</p></div>

Python provides various libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, TensorFlow, scikit-learn and other important tools required for data science processing. Furthermore, it provides other tools like Flask, support for SQLite and other functionalities that can lead to a comprehensive data product. Python IDEs for data science that make data analysis and machine learning easier! Let's also see which are the most popular Python IDE and text editors. It's important to note that the below statistics are from December 2018 and should give a good understanding of what is popular today.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure3: Popular Python IDEs</head><p>With a running course of almost 3 decades, Python has garnered enormous popularity among the programming community. Using IDLE or the Python Shell for writing down Python code is effectual for smaller projects, but not practical while working on full-fledged machine learning or data science projects. In such a case, you need to use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or a dedicated code editor. As Python is one of the leading programming languages, there is a multitude of IDEs available. So, the question is, "Which is the best IDE for Python?" Seemingly, there is no single IDE or code editor for Python that can be crowned with "THE BEST" label. This is because each of them has their own strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, choosing among the vast number of IDEs might be time-consuming. Worry not though, as we've reviewed. In order to help you pick the right one, we've analyzed some of the prominent IDEs for Python, specifically created for working with data science projects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Jupyter Lab:</head><p>Jupyter was introduced in 2014 and is a successor to iPython. It is a web application based on a server-client structure which is free, open-source, and easy to use. Its name is a reference to three core programming languages supported by Jupyter -Julia, Python, and R. But Jupyter supports over 40 programming languages! Most data scientists have worked with Jupyter notebooks at some point or another in their lives because of the functionalities and ease of use it offers. But the classic Jupyter notebooks are getting a make-over with the next generation JupyterLab launched in 2018. It is a web-based IDE for data science that serves as a great starting place for data science beginners.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure4: JupyterLab Interface</head><p>Jupyter provides an interactive output which means you can write your code and test it there and then. This becomes extremely useful when you are a beginner and just starting out your journey in machine learning and data science. In addition to writing your Python code, you can create great notebooks that contain visualizations and text explanations using the markdown editor which even enables you to write even Latex equations! It brings the terminal, text editor, console, and file directory view all under the same roof in a single work area with a flexible layout. Using the various magic commands and notebook extensions, you can really augment the functionalities of Jupyter. You can add features like auto-formatting, debugging, autosave, auto code completion, and much, much more. There is even a zen mode extension to minimize distractions and maximize productivity! The notebooks that you create with JupyterLab can be downloaded in a variety of formats ranging from pdf to .py files and even as slides for presentations! JupyterLab comes bundled with the Anaconda distribution. This makes it quite easy to install JupyterLab and other IDEs t. It is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS s platforms. Simple and elegant code writing ability. Easier to understand the code that way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ï‚·</head><p>The ability to see the output after each step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ï‚·</head><p>The ability to use ton of library functions in Python.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ï‚·</head><p>Jupyter has an easy navigation platform compared to others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ï‚·</head><p>Jupyter makes python programming because of some compelling features like viewing details of bash executions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ï‚·</head><p>We can use it as a notebook and share the slide and publish it online through GitHub. There is no IDE integration. ï‚· Should include more programming language. ï‚· Need more Hotkeys for creating a beautiful notebook. Sometimes we need to download other plugins which messes its default settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ï‚·</head><p>Once the data exploration, experimentation and prototyping are done, you usually need to move the analytics 'to production,' which is software development and should result in scalable, maintainable, robust code. You simply do not want to do this with a notebook, but develop a properly structured set of source files with an IDE like Spyder or PyCharm that supports things like version control, running automated tests etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">PyCharm</head><p>PyCharm, like the name suggests, is a charming Python IDE created by JetBrains, the company behind the popular IntelliJ IDEA IDE for Java. It is a great IDE to try out if you are looking to work on a project containing multiple scripts interacting with each other. PyCharm is suited for any developer who wishes to create software applications in Python, be it web applications, data science applications, or even just a simple Python script. PyCharm lets you get your work done quickly and efficiently! PyCharm has two versionsa free Community version and a paid Professional version that is available for a free 30-day trial, giving you the opportunity to try out whether you want it as your new Python IDE. Both of these can be downloaded from this page for either Windows, Linux, or macOS. To compare the two versions, you can have a look at the image below which will give you an overview of the features that are missing in the free version:</p><p>Luckily, if you are a student or are teaching at an education facility, you can apply to get access to all JetBrains IDEs for free. All you have to do is apply for it on this webpage and you will get free access to all of JetBrains's IDEs. PyCharm clearly has a lot to offer and will surely be able to tackle all the development work related to Python, from web development to data science applications. PyCharm can be a resource-intensive IDE requiring plenty of memory and storage space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure5: PyCharm Interface</head><p>Let's list some of PyCharm's key features that make it such a popular IDE among developers: â€¢PyCharm's code editor is second to none. It has syntax and error highlighting, code analysis, and quick fixes for instantly improving the code. Additional features like auto-code generation, auto-indentation, code folder, etc. also make it incredibly comfortable to code in PyCharm The process of upgrading IDE versions can be improved for the Linux environment as we need to download a new version and use it. This does not happen when it works on Windows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ï‚·</head><p>Failure to learn to learn all the features of the IDE, making the most of all its functions. At least I didn't find this description.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ï‚·</head><p>The value of the full version is very expensive, thinking about the location I am in.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ï‚·</head><p>These new versions use a lot of machine feature. Java consuming a lot of memory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ï‚·</head><p>Copy-paste does not work correctly. The default printing is in the form of Insert. I always need to press the enter button to come out of the insert mode and also have to right-click and select copy or paste instead of default CNTRL c and CNTRL V. It is working good for some others in the team, and I am not able to fix this.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ï‚·</head><p>Too much of underlining the code considering negligible errors make the code look bad. ï‚· Auto suggestions sometimes does not work as expected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ï‚·</head><p>Abstracting commands into UI dialogs is nice. However, due to this the language changes, making it non-obvious to use sometimes. Tooltips for text boxes can eliminate the need for additional googling ï‚· Memory intensive -only a beefy machine can host this IDE in its full glory. Modular and plugin-based approach like VS Code can only load those features into using a loop or such thing. ï‚· Switch between one project to the other is done very easily using PyCharm when compared with other tools. ï‚· Syntax highlighting and printing different colors for a method, variable, code, and comment also helps in concluding what is what.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ï‚·</head><p>One can create a java file, can connect to DB, can connect to different servers with Unix, and can also create an automation framework using a robotic framework, which in turn makes it an RPA tool.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ï‚·</head><p>Light and dark theme also helps a lot while working at late nights and during the daytime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ï‚·</head><p>Git integration is really essential as it allows anyone to visually see the local and remote changes, compare revisions without the need for complex commands. The biggest complaint I have about PyCharm is that it can use a lot of RAMS which slows down the computer / IDE. I use the paid version, and have otherwise found nothing to complain about the interface, utility, and capabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ï‚·</head><p>Startup speed: could be faster ï‚· Runtime environment: needs to change the runtime every time I want to switch from code to test cases ï‚· Updates: on Ubuntu 14.04, updating is a little bit troublesome: must be done manually, cannot be updated automatically ï‚·</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Spyder</head><p>Spyder is a scientific environment for Python, built for scientists, engineers and data analysts. It combines advanced editing, analysis, debugging, and profiling functionality of a comprehensive development tool with data exploration, interactive execution, deep inspection, and visualization capabilities similar to a scientific package. Spyder is sponsored by open-source supporters QuanSight, and NumFOCUS, as well as individual donors. This is a lightweight, free, and opensource Python IDE. It is completely written in Python and designed exclusively for data scientists and analysts. Its interface is very basic when you compare it to other IDEs, but it has all the necessary components we look for in a coding environment. It consists of a text editor, file explorer, variable explorer, and IPython console all in a single window. It has built-in integration with many popular scientific packages including NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, IPython, and others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure6: Spyder Interface</head><p>Here are some of the key features Spyder offers: ï‚· A pretty decent code editor with features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and real-time code analysis, which highlights the potential problem or a syntax error in your code ï‚· An interactive code execution that allows you to execute your code by line, by cell block, or run the entire file in a single go, leaving the choice entirely up to you! ï‚· An IPython console if you just want to test out a few lines of code without wanting to disrupt your primary session ï‚· A Variable editor showing the variables, functions, modules, etc. of the currently selected IPython Console session. It also provides several built-in supports for editing objects like lists, strings, tuples, etc. along with a really awesome feature to display some of them as an image or even a plot! ï‚·</p><p>The Static code analysis feature detects style issues, bad practices, potential bugs, and other quality problems in your code, without even having to actually execute it.

CONCLUSION Which is the Best IDE?, The answer to this is subjective, but it would still be a good idea to start with an IDE that is less convoluted if you are at a beginner level. Once you get a good handle on coding, you should then switch to a better IDE that has a lot of the built-in features that will allow you to code more efficiently. Features of a Good IDE Integrated Debugger: A debugger is used to debug program errors and bugs. This feature enables developers to step through their code while executing it. In case if something goes wrong during execution, it would help them find where exactly the error occurred. For example, suppose I am trying to execute my code "print " and instead of printing 'Hello world', it throws an exception saying "SyntaxError: invalid syntax". If I don't know what went wrong, I might try stepping into the code and see how far it got before throwing up an error. With a debugger, I could easily figure out why the code didn't work. In most IDEs, the debugger escalates through your code and applies breakpoints for executing the code partially. Highlighting of syntaxes: Having the option to spot keywords, variables, and symbols in your code makes perusing and understanding code a lot simpler. Automated formatting of Code: A rather intriguing element, the code indents itself as you use functions, and loops while you compose your program. Automatically save and reload source code: A developer's schedule is tightly packed indeed, and hence an IDE should save your work and resume everything later -in a similar state it was in when you left to save you time later on. Execution from within the environment: It ought to have an inherent compiler to execute your code, if not, then it's merely a code text editor.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>ï‚·</head><label></label><figDesc>Attractive programming environment. ï‚· Developing code snippets for big or small projects ï‚· Highly recommended data analysis presentation ï‚· Should work on Configuration setup, it takes a lot of time. ï‚· Work on code styling correction, sometimes it makes a major difference. ï‚·</figDesc></figure>
